Communities
======

Since the topic *Communities* is somewhat more complicated I would like to go here a little bit into it.
Generally, communities should be used with caution.


Why it is complicated?
------

Communities are generally a homogeneous mass that has grown together over months or even years. 
They are people who know each other and often there are moderators, fans, makers, different people who have put in 
a lot of time and effort to keep the community running.

Building a community and keeping it alive is one of the most difficult things to do in life. 

Now put yourself in the position of these people when you come along as a newbie and simply post your product / idea.

How would you feel if you put years of work into a community and someone 
just wants to use your work without adding value to the community?


How to post now?
------

Some communities are specifically aimed at making you share your idea / product with them. 
For example **Product Hunt** would be such a great place.

But even here you should consider, if you are not active, it could be, that your product does not find attention.
It is even advisable that you find someone who is active in the community and who will post your product. 

But even here, if someone has 15k 20k or 100k or even a million followers, there are years of long work behind it.
Respect the work of these influencers. and you don't do that when you come along, *"hey yo, can you post my cool product?"*


Recommendation from me
------

- Be active for a while before you post your product.

When my first product was posted on Product Hunt, I was active for a while. 
Not for two or three weeks. It was several months.

- Add value to the community

If the community is a DIY community for the garden, then it doesn't help if your product is for an ecommerce product.
In germany there is a saying: *Schuster bleib bei deinen Leisten* 
That means as much as: stick to the subject you're good at.

- Make contacts

Make your presence felt in the community. Make contacts and try to help others.
Not only that you will be helped later if you are helpful, you never know what contacts are helpful for in the future.

You never know what the future holds. 
When I was active on Product Hunt for some time, I found more and more cool products and services. 
I am still active on Product Hunt today and I've grown really fond of it now.

In the meantime i found some really good products there. Think about posting your product in a community where you are not active.


What can happen?
------

- In the best case, your product won't attract attention

- Worst-case scenario? Your product is talked extremely badly by Influencer from the community, 
your reputation suffers extremely from it and people still remember it after 2 years.

Do you want to be remembered that way? I don't think so.
Be helpful and try to add value for others, the rest comes all by itself in most cases. 
And yes, damn it, it's a shitload of work!
